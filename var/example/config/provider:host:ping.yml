# Monitoring controller configuration
# =================================================
# This is an example of a complete controller configuration.

# Meta information
# -------------------------------------------------
# This is used in displaying and communicating with the user.

name: Local ping
description: >
  Ping to the server internally indicates that the local network settings are correct.

# Monitor runtime configuration
# -------------------------------------------------

# Time (in seconds) to rerun the check.
interval: 300
# Time (in seconds) in which the value is seen as valid and should not be rechecked.
validity: 60
# Run this test only on a machine which has the same setting under `monitor.runat`
# configuration.
runat: vz23761
# It may be disabled temporarily, seen as ok without check
disabled: false

# Dependencies
# -------------------------------------------------
# The list of dependencies are controllers and sensors which have to work to make
# this one work. Use `checkdepend: true` in the `actor` config to skip action
# if this is not the cause controller.
# It is possible to combine sensors and controllers here. The weight parameter
# is specific to the combine method, see below.
depend:
  - sensor: ping
    config:
      host: 85.25.98.24
  - sensor: ping
    config:
      host: 85.25.98.25
  - controller: mysql
    weight: 2

# ### Combine values
# For multiple dependencies this value defines how the individual sensors or
# controllers are combined to  calculate the overall status:
#
# - `or` - the highest status will be used (supporting weight: min)
# - `and` - only the highest common status is used (supporting weight: max)
# - `average` - the average value will be used (supporting weight: 0..9)
combine: or

# Monitor Activities
# -------------------------------------------------
rules:
  - # Only work on specific status.
    status: fail
    # Number of minimum attempts before informing.
    attempt: 3
    # Time (in seconds) to wait before informing.
    latency: 60
    # Only inform if dependent jobs not failed. This prevents of hundred of
    # messages if a central system failed.
    dependskip: true
    # Timeout (in seconds) without status change before informing again.
    redo: 1800
    # Type of actor to run with it's configuration

# Help in problem solving
# ------------------------------------------------
# This will be used to give the user more information about the possible problem
# and what may be done.-
hint: >
  If the local ping won't work it may be a problem with the network card or
  it's configuration.
